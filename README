(W)atch (ENT)ire (D)irector(Y) is an inotify-based directory watcher.

With wendy, you can watch event in a directory or on a file, and launch a
specific command when an event occurs.

The program is made the moire simple possible, to leave the room to unlimited
uses. Be creative !

Here are some examples:

    # Tell me whenever I have a new mail
    wendy -C ~/mails/INBOX/new -t 60 -e espeak "You got a new mail"

    # On-the-fly recompilation
    wendy -M -f ~/src/dev/program/source.c -t 1 -e make

    # Get up to date with community based projects
    wendy -DMC -f /mnt/nfs/project/ -t 30 -e notify-send 'project updated'
