===========================

(W)atch (ENT)ire (D)irector(Y) is an inotify-based directory watcher.

With wendy, you can watch event in a directory or on a file, and launch a
specific command when an event occurs.

The program is made the moire simple possible, to leave the room to unlimited
uses. Be creative !

Every event raised by inotify is handled. Just sum them up to watch multiple
event at the same time. Here is the full table:
(see inotify(1) for a better explanation of those events)

    IN_ACCESS ........ 1
    IN_MODIFY ........ 2
    IN_ATTRIB ........ 4
    IN_CLOSE_WRITE ... 8
    IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE . 16
    IN_OPEN .......... 32
    IN_MOVED_FROM .... 64
    IN_MOVED_TO ...... 128
    IN_CREATE ........ 256
    IN_DELETE ........ 512
    IN_DELETE_SELF ... 1024
    IN_MOVE_SELF ..... 2048

To watch for both creation AND deletion in a directory, do some math:

    256 + 512 = 768

then, pass that value to wendy so that she can watch after both of them (did I
just say 'she'?).

For more convenience, the IN_CREATE, IN_DELETE and IN_MODIFY events are bound to
(respectively) -C, -D and -M.

Here are some examples:

    # Tell me whenever I have a new mail
    wendy -C -d ~/mails/INBOX/new -t 60 -e espeak "You got a new mail"

    # On-the-fly recompilation
    wendy -M -q -d ~/src/dev/program/ -f source.c -t 1 -e make
    # or eventually
    wendy -l | grep -i close_write
    IN_CLOSE_WRITE ... 8
    wendy -m 8 -q -d ~/src/dev/program/ -f source.c -t 1 -e make


    # Get up to date with community based projects
    wendy -D -M -C -d /mnt/nfs/project/ -t 30 -e notify-send 'project updated'
